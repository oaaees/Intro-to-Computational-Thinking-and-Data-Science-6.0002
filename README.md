![enter image description here](https://ocw.mit.edu/images/mit-ol.png)

This repo is made to track my progress through MIT course [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science 6.0002](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/pages/syllabus/), while the course is taught using Python I coded the exercises in C++.

## Folders
Each folder contains the files for each lecture, you can watch them on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP619EG1wp0kT-7rDE_Az5TNd) or in [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/video_galleries/lecture-videos/).
To run the programs you will need to compile and execute them.

		 $		 g++ main.cpp (other .cpp files) -o test
		 $		./test
